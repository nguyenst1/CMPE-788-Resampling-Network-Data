# CMPE-788-Resampling-Network-Data

## 1. Overview:

This project aims to implement a resampling technique for imbalanced Network Traffic Datasets. It combines various state-of-the-art resampling techniques and conducts several experiments with different techniques and compare their performances.

## 2. Files structure:

The `src` folder contains three Jupyter Notebook files aka three parts of the project, which implement different re-sampling techniques on two different datasets. The following are brief descriptions of each source file:

- `CMPE_788_final_project_part1.ipynb`: This file implements the Naive Bayes algorithm on the news dataset and evaluates its performance.

- `svm.ipynb`: This file implements the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm on a different dataset and evaluates its performance.

- `logistic_regression.ipynb`: This file implements the Logistic Regression algorithm on a different dataset and evaluates its performance.

- `ensemble.ipynb`: This file implements an ensemble of multiple machine learning models on a different dataset and evaluates its performance.

Each source file contains a detailed description of the algorithm used, the dataset it is applied to, and the performance metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.


## 3. How to run this project
User can simply load the notebook the `News_Dataset_Topic_Classification_Models_&_NN.ipynb` file either locally or via Google Colab and hit "play" button.
